# Tensorflow mbed test for CNN model

This folder has been autogenerated by TensorFlow, and contains source, header,
and project files needed to build a single TensorFlow Lite Micro target using
the Mbed command line interface.

It shows a example program where an inference of CNN model is done.


## Get started

To load the dependencies this code requires, run:

```
mbed config root .
mbed deploy
```

To compile this for any platform supported by mbed:

```
mbed compile -m auto -t GCC_ARM -f --profile my_profile.json -f
```

To compile this for Nucleo_F767ZI dev board you can run:

```
make flash -j4
```

Adjust -j flag to number of your cores, for faster building process.


In both cases you will get messages on serial port, baud speed 9600, you can view it with:
```
minicom -b 9600
```

## Expected speed time

Expected time of inference on Nucleo_F767ZI is 486 ms.
